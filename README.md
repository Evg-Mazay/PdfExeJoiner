# PdfExeJoiner
This program can create hybrid file that is both valid .exe application and valid .pdf[^1] document.
I use it to transfer files via social network that doesn't allow .exe file attachment (vk.com).

You can join any .exe file with almost[^2] any .pdf file.

* If you rename result file to .pdf, it can be viewed as usual pdf document.
* if you rename result file to .exe, it can be run as usual windows program.
